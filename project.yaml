Create a project that will deploy in Kubernetes that is effectively a test to send data to loki mamir tempo. 

The website should show a whole bunch of little flames and give you a button to press plus or minus and that makes more or less flames It needs to provide trace data as well as generate an amount of logs that's a lot and metrics all that will be scraped by Grafana's alloy The configuration should take an end point that sends to an alloy supercluster so think of this as otel collector endpoint that's already been set The onboarding process should be just run the docker container run the kubernetes deployment I need you to provide the kubernetes deployment all files associated with this the how to build it the web front end should look like a dark theme from similar to Apple's website perhaps Let me know if you have any questions I don't care about the tech stack make it simple yet once again it needs to send trace data log data as well as metrics allow those to all be scraped or picked up natively from otel or sent to an otel endpoint let me know if you have questions
